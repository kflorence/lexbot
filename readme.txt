Version Info:
------------+
this bot was completed on November 16, 2002 at 6:51 
pm EST.  This is the first release of this bot 
(used to be Claire-Bot) so this is actually claire-bot v4, 
but i got tired of the name and decided it needed a new one.
This has the additions of being able to rename the trigger
state for the bot (ie *anything* quotecount <nick>).
now it is no longer limited to (ie claire linecount <nick>).
I also worked on the appearence of the bot, i hope you
enjoy the colors. you can always change them if you'd like.
